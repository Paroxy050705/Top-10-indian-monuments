<h1><b><i>TYPES OF HOLIDAYS</i></b></h1>
<h2 id="#family">Family Holidays</h2>
Vacation is said to be the best time for everyone. We all eagerly wait for this time of the year and have numerous plans set for the same. But many a times it happens that we keep making plans for the vacations but never execute them. For some the plans never materialize just because they keep procrastinating, others do not have good company while yet others do not have enough budget.

Like everyone else, I also make a lot of plans for my vacations. While earlier most of my holidays went wasted just because I wasted time procrastinating. Towards the end of the vacations, I always regretted having wasted them all. However, now I plan my vacations properly. This gives me a feeling of joy and content.

On regular days, we often don’t have a lot of time to spend with our friends and family. So, during vacations, we can use this opportunity to meet up with them and have a good time together. You can also think about going on a trip with your family or friends to take a break from your daily routine. It’s a good idea to plan at least one trip during your summer or winter holidays.

During my summer and winter vacations, I make sure that I have at least one short trip planned with my family. If my family members do not have enough time to plan a trip during my vacations, I go on a trip planned by my school. Such trips are extremely exciting and rejuvenating. I also make sure I devote few hours a day to study each day during the vacations.

Besides, I love helping my mother with household tasks and also enjoy going out shopping with her. I always look forward to vacations and love every bit of them.

Holidays are rightly known as pressure busters for the people. The normal routine of life requires a few days to relax. The holidays are always welcomed and awaited by all. Holidays give us immense peace and we cherish the memories of these well-spent days for the rest of our lives. Holidays help us in the following ways:

Mental Peace: 

We can derive mental harmony and mental calmness by staying at home and also by spending the holiday time with friends and family. 

Social Activities: 

The students in their holidays can also include the social activities that they do with their loved ones. 

Family Trip: 

We enjoy a family trip or a family excursion during these holidays.  


It is to be understood that gaining money is significant for livelihood, but relaxing the mind to make it function better is also as important. Hence, for the smooth working of life, a break is certainly required. 

<h2 id="#city">City breaks</h2>

City destinations have a little something for everyone, from fine dining to street food, upscale hotels to hostel vibes, and park lounging to incredible art shows and museums. And the best thing about city breaks is that you can book a short weekend getaway or a week‑long stay – either way there’s plenty of places to stay and eat, and lots to do.

Whether it’s the world‑famous sights of London, the quirky backstreets and big name attractions of Tokyo or the familiar pleasures of New York, our city break destinations are calling out for you to indulge and explore.

Where Magic Meets the Sea
Discover Disney Cruise Line, where every holiday is a magical adventure at sea. Experience dazzling live shows, signature Disney dining and action-packed kids clubs that only Disney can create. 



Relax in Disney-inspired accommodations, splash it up in fun-filled water play areas, meet beloved Disney Characters, pamper yourself with luxurious spa treatments and explore exclusive shopping opportunities—all while enjoying our world-renowned hospitality and attention to detail.

<h2 id="#multi">Multi center & tours</h2>
With so many tempting destinations to choose from, why stop at one if you don’t have to. Our multi-centre holidays give you the chance to combine two or more places, so you can make the most of every experience and enjoy twice the holiday.

With our extensive flight network, over 12,000 hotels across the globe and fantastic fly-drive packages, it’s never been easier to customise your trip. Many of our destinations can be easily combined, so you can hop from one city to another and make as many cultural discoveries as possible. If adventure is on your mind, but you could also do with some time to relax, a twin centre offers the best of both worlds. Or break the journey up with a short stopover en-route to somewhere further afield.

<h2 id="#safari">Safari holidays</h2>
Each day on safari in Africa is a magical experience, whether you’re exploring the savanna on foot or in a 4x4 vehicle in search of the Big 5, taking to the sky in a hot-air balloon to witness the Great Wildebeest Migration, or hiking through the thick rainforests of Uganda or Rwanda on a gorilla trek. Every single day is steeped in the promise of a unique adventure and cherished memories.

Although each day is unpredictable to a certain extent, based on the time of year or location, there is a general format or schedule that safaris tend to follow but, as a rule, safari does follow a familiar rhythm that combines thrilling game viewing with ample time to relax in between – a dream vacation in anyone’s book. One rule of thumb is that there are usually two game drives a day – one in the early morning and late afternoon when animals are at their most active.

If you want a more detailed look at what your schedule might be, we put together a guide that takes a deep dive into what to expect on a typical day on safari in Africa, when staying at a traditional lodge or camps that offers game drives in a national park, private concession or conservancy.



<h2 id="#ski">Ski holidays</h2>
West Virginia is an exceptional place to test your fishing prowess with more than 3,000 kilometers of streams and 100-plus fishing lakes. Sign up with an expert outfitter who will provide the necessary equipment for a guided fishing tour or fly-fishing excursion. Make it a trip for the whole family by chartering or renting a boat. Cast a line for trout along the south branch of the Potomac River or drift along nearby Blackwater River for your prize fish. Located inside of Blackwater Falls State Park, Pendleton Lake offers a variety of species to reel in such as rainbow trout, bass and bluegill.

Insider tip: Round out your trip with a luxury cabin rental. After a day on the water, a cozy night spent by a roaring fire feels like a win – big catch or not. If you’re fishing solo (not with an outfitter), get your fishing license online beforehand.
