   <p>Collective Retreats is proud to be the first and largest global outdoor hospitality brand to receive certified B-Corp status.

 

Since our inception, our core values have been focused on continually creating positive social and environmental impact for the communities we serve. This certification represents a milestone in our commitment to connect people, build a greater awareness for the natural beauty that surrounds us and reinforce our deep-rooted belief that we can deliver unique luxury travel experiences that are more memorable and less extractive than traditional hotels.

 Hotels can be a surprisingly dirty business. Tourism is responsible for roughly 8% of the worldâ€™s carbon emissions. The majority is emitted by visitors from high-income countries, with U.S. travelers at the top of the list. We founded Collective Retreats to solve this problem and our team is connected by a deep and relentless passion for our cause. We need to protect the beautiful places we love to explore and enjoy and are committed to uplifting the people and communities we rely on for services, experiences, and indulgences.

 

Collective Retreats is a Public Benefit Corporation, a corporate structure which legally obligates us to consider the impact of our decisions on the environment, not just shareholders.

 

As part of our sustainability and stewardship initiatives, we have partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation and will be planting one tree for every stay booked at a Collective Retreats location to help fight deforestation and climate change.
